      Hi! I'm a passionate learner who loves exploring new technologies and
      building things from scratch. I began my journey with{" "}
      <span className="font-semibold">Angular</span>, then moved on to{" "}
      <span className="font-semibold">React</span>, where I built my first
      projects. As my curiosity grew, I dived into backend development with
      Spring, and now I'm exploring mobile development with{" "}
      <span className="font-semibold">Flutter</span>. I'm always excited to
      learn, improve, and take on new challenges.
